I need to execute a validation command to check things are set up correctly. I’m also considering inspecting the git diff, but maybe that's not strictly necessary right now. Do I need any commentary before doing substantial work? It seems like a good idea, so I think I should include that. So, yes, running the exact validation command is my next step to ensure everything works as it should!
