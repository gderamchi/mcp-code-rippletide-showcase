I’m encountering some problems with commands not outputting as expected. I wonder if perhaps `sed` is waiting longer than it should. It’s possible that TTY could be involved? There may be too many lines, leading to the session not being flushed properly. I think it’s worth checking if I need to implement a polling method to address this issue. Let’s explore that possibility.
