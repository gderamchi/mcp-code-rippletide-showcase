I need to inspect some files and possibly run a test to check for failures. It seems like a good idea to read the files first. Should I use parallel commands like cat and sed or ripgrep (rg)? I’m leaning towards using sed with the -n option to filter the output. I wonder which approach will be most effective for this task. It’s important to ensure I'm thorough!
